				<h1>About</h1><br>
				<div class="description">
					<p>The <i>Great British Bake Off (GBBO)</i> is a British television baking competition where
						12 amateur bakers compete against each other over the course of twelve weeks. Each week, a theme 
						is assigned (i.e. Pastry Week) and the contestants bake to impress the judges in the Signature, 
						Technical, and Show Stopper rounds.

					<h1>Show Popularity</h1>
					<p> Viewership for GBBO increases continuously until series 8, where it drops and plateaus thereafter. 
						<em class="text-emphasis">Why did the viewership drop by almost 5 million in Series 8?</em> After series 7, the GBBO moved from BBC One to Channel 4, and 
						previous judge Mary Berry and presenters Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins left the show out of loyalty to BBC. Some
						viewers were also disappointed about the move since it meant the show would now include advertisements.
